## How to access/run files on the Jetson
Open the LXTerminal on the Jetson, and activate the virtual environment by pasting the following line of code: ```source ~/.py3venv/bin/activate```. Change the directory to access Herbie's programs by typing `cd herbieATX`. To open a file type `gedit filename.py`. The same line can be used to create a new file with the filename of choice.  
To run a python file typ `python3.8 -m filename.py`. When you are done accessing and running code type `deactivate` to close the virtual environment before exiting the terminal.
